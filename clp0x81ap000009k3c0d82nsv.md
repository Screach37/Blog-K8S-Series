## **Introduction**

In the realm of automation, Ansible shines as a user-friendly tool that simplifies complex tasks. This blog post is your passport to Ansible, covering everything from installation to executing your first playbook. Let's dive in!

## **Installing Ansible**

Getting started with Ansible is a breeze. Here's a simple guide to install Ansible on your system:

### **1\. On Linux (Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

### **2\. On MacOS:**

```bash
brew install ansible
```

### **3\. On Windows:**

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    
2. Open WSL and follow the Linux installation steps.
    

Once installed, you're ready to harness the power of Ansible.

## **Setting Up in the Master Node**

Ansible follows a simple master-node architecture. Your machine, where Ansible is installed, becomes the control node, while the target machines are the managed nodes. Let's set up the master node:

### **1\. Inventory File**

Create a file named `inventory.ini` to define your managed nodes:

```bash
# Inventory File
# This file defines the managed nodes for Ansible.

# You can define single user
# Example
192.168.1.0
# Define a group of hosts named 'targets'
[targets]
# Specify the IP address of the managed node
[ip_address] ansible_ssh_user=your_username

# Specify additional managed nodes
# You can add more nodes with similar configurations
192.168.1.102 ansible_ssh_user=your_username
192.168.1.103 ansible_ssh_user=your_username

# Define a group of database servers
# Specify the IP address and SSH user for the database server
[database_servers]
10.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_user=db_admin

# Define a group of web servers
# Specify the IP address and SSH user for the web server
[web_servers]
10.0.0.2 ansible_ssh_user=web_admin
```

### **2\. Configuring Ansible**

Create a configuration file, `ansible.cfg`, to set up basic configurations:

```bash
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory.ini
```

Your master node is ready to orchestrate tasks on the managed nodes.

## **Your First Ansible Playbook: Hello World Ping**

Now, let's create a simple playbook to ensure everything is set up correctly. Create a file named `hello_world_ping.yml`:

```bash
---
# Hello World Playbook
# This playbook demonstrates pinging all machines and displaying a message.

# Define the playbook
- name: Hello World Playbook
  # Specify the group of hosts from the inventory file
  hosts: all

  # List of tasks to be executed
  tasks:
    # Task 1: Ping all machines
    - name: Ping All Machines
      # Ansible 'ping' module to check connectivity
      ping:

    # Task 2: Display "hello from team" message on the terminal
    - name: Display Hello Message
      # Ansible 'command' module to run a command on the control node
      command: echo "Hello from DevToDevOps team"
```

Here's a breakdown of what this playbook does:

* `name`: A human-readable description for the playbook.
    
* `hosts`: Specifies the group of hosts from the inventory file.
    
* `tasks`: Defines the list of tasks to be executed.
    
* `ping`: An Ansible module to check connectivity to the managed nodes.
    
* `command`: An Ansible module that allows the execution of arbitrary commands on the control node.
    

## **Executing Your Playbook**

Run your playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook hello_world_ping.yml
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a successful ping response from the managed node and our message "Hello from DevToDevOps team" on the terminal.

Congratulations! You've just executed your first Ansible playbook. This is just the beginning â€“ Ansible's simplicity and power await your exploration. Stay tuned for more Ansible adventures!
